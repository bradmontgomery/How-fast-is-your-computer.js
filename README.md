How fast is your computer?
--------------------------

This is a (slightly modified) JavaScript version of the applet from
the [How fast is your computer?](http://www.sciencebuddies.org/science-fair-projects/project_ideas/CompSci_p011.shtml#summary) experiment over at ScienceBuddies.org.

I built this because I wanted to run the experiment on an iPhone and an iPad.

It uses a web worker to run the calculations. That way your browser shouldn't annoy you about the script taking too long to run.
